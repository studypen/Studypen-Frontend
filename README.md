# ABOUT STUDYPEN


## `Abstract`

The issue of online classes is very paramount during the situation of covid-19. So, this project is aimed at developing an online website that will be an important thing for the students as well as the professors of the JIS University. This website can be accessed by the students and the professors so the students can access their routine, syllabus, lectures, assignments and the professors can take the classes, gives assignments, reschedule classes etc.  

## `Objective of the Project`

This project is mainly aimed at the online classes during quarantine. We tried to make a website where professors can interact with the students like they can take classes, give assignment, reschedule their extra classes as well as the students can use this website to attend their classes, see their routine and syllabus, check mails etc. Our main motive behind making this website is to give the professors and students the easiest way to attend classes online.  

## `Problems and Solutions`

Sometimes some students forget about the routine and miss classes or sometime they don't get any notification if any professor uploads any assignment. So, In this website every student will get a notification whenever any professor uploads assignment and before their classes.

## `Results and Conclusion`

Online classes are so much important during the Covid-19 situation and so are the assignments and lectures. So, we tried to develop a website which fulfills all these needs for both students and professors. As the end of this project, we successfully made the website. There are still some bugs and problems in this website but we will try our best and make sure that Studypen becomes a perfect one.
